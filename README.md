Do El Ni単o events beget generations of reproductively deficient adults?
Abstract
El Ni単o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, which are predicted to increase in frequency due to climate change, significantly impact marine ecosystems by disrupting food availability. These effects are particularly severe for seabirds, which experience delayed breeding, reduced reproductive success, and increased mortality during ENSO years. This study investigated whether ENSO conditions experienced during early life have long-term fitness consequences in a population of blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii) on Isla Isabel, Mexico. Using data from 33 birth cohorts between 1990 and 2023, we assessed fledging success, recruitment probability, and lifetime reproductive performance. While fledging and recruitment probabilities were negatively impacted by higher ENSO values, particularly in second and third-hatched chicks, no long-term fitness deficits were observed in adults from El Ni単o birth cohorts. Despite the early-life adversity, adults showed similar age at first reproduction, longevity, and reproductive output compared to those born in neutral or favourable La Ni単a years. Our results suggest that developmental resilience and selective survival (filtering) during the juvenile stage may mitigate the long-term reproductive impacts of ENSO on this population. These findings contribute to our understanding of how long-lived species can buffer against the increasing frequency of extreme climatic events, emphasizing the importance of individual quality in overcoming early-life environmental stress.
